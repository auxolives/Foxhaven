## Server Setup Guide (Beta Phase)

This guide will walk you through setting up the core gameplay mechanics for your Foxhaven server. As the map is in beta, the primary configuration is handled through the `Config.json` file. Future updates will include distinct mission files, central economy files, and more, which will be added to this repository.

### Step 1: Choose Your Gameplay Preset

Foxhaven comes with two main presets. Choose the one that best fits your server's desired experience.

* **Hardcore:** Scarce loot, more difficult dynamic events and enables custom scripts like penalties for low stats, steep terrain, and carrying heavy loads. This is the recommended default.
* **Casual:** Normal loot, central economy and dynamic events. Disables custom scripts. This provides an experience closer to vanilla DayZ.

> Of course, feel free to customize it as you see fit

### Step 2: Setup your serverDZ.cfg

Your serverDZ.cfg needs to be concomitent to your server init.c time management. By default, Foxhaven is meant to boot on July 1st and will circle back every July 21st. You are free to change this to change sunrise, sunset times, sun angle, and temperatures (configurable in cfggameplay.json - Step 3).

### Step 3: Copy the Mission Files of your Choice

Copy the entire `dayzOffline.foxhaven/` folder [üåê from your chosen preset](https://github.com/auxolives/Foxhaven/tree/main/server) and past it in your `mpmissions/` folder.

### Step 4: Configure `Config.json`

Copy the entire `profiles/Foxhaven/` folder [üåê from your chosen preset](https://github.com/auxolives/Foxhaven/tree/main/server) and past it in your server's `profiles/` folder. Or just launch the server once to automatically generate it and adjust it accordingly.

#### Important Configuration Notes

* **Error Handling:** If your `Config.json` has a syntax error, the server will **not** crash. It will log the error and load default values for that session. To fix this, you can delete your `Config.json` to have a clean one generated on the next restart.
* **Manual Updates:** This configuration file does **not** update automatically. When the map receives an update, please check back here for any new parameters to add to your file. If new parameters are missing, it will load their default hardcore values.

## Advanced Customization: `Config.json` Parameters Explained

If you want to fine-tune the gameplay mechanics beyond the presets, use the detailed explanations below.

### `isHeatBufferEnabled`
This setting toggles the vanilla "heat buffer" mechanic, which allows players to build up a temporary resistance to cold.
* **`0`**: The heat buffer mechanic is **disabled**.
* **`1`**: The heat buffer mechanic is **enabled** (vanilla behavior).

### `movementPenaltiesSettings`
This section contains all settings related to penalties that affect a player's movement and injury animation level.

#### `playerEnergyWaterBloodSettings`
* **`isPenaltyEnabled`**: Toggles penalties from low character stats. When enabled, low blood, energy, or water will increase the player's "injury" level, making them move as if they were injured.

#### `terrainSlopeSettings`
* **`isPenaltyEnabled`**: Toggles penalties from moving up or down steep terrain.
* **`slope..._deg`**: These values are the **angle thresholds in degrees** at which the player's animation level increases. Higher angles result in more severe movement penalties.
    * `slopeUp...`: Penalties for moving **uphill**.
    * `slopeDown...`: Penalties for moving **downhill**.

#### `weightSettings`
* **`isPenaltyEnabled`**: Toggles penalties from carrying a heavy load.
* **`loadPenaltyLevel..._g`**: These values are the **total character weight thresholds in grams** at which the player receives an increasing movement penalty.
    * `1000g` = `1kg`.
    * Default `Level 1` is **50kg**.
